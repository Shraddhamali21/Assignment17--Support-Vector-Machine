1. FOREST FIRE DATASET

In this data science project, I addressed the task of classifying the size category of forest fires using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Leveraging the power of SVM, I aimed to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting whether a forest fire would result in a small or large burned area based on various environmental and meteorological factors. The dataset used for this analysis is named "forestfires.csv," containing attributes such as month, day, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, along with the corresponding size categories of forest fires (Small or Large). Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project is to develop a classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the size category of forest fires based on environmental and meteorological factors. By analyzing attributes such as month, day, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies forest fires into two categories: Small or Large. This classification model can help forest management authorities and firefighters anticipate the severity of forest fires and allocate resources accordingly.
 
Approach:
 
The project follows a structured approach to model development and analysis, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the environmental and meteorological variables, as well as the size categories of forest fires.
 - Preprocessing the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
 
2. Model Training using SVM:
 - Implementing the SVM algorithm to build a classification model for predicting the size category of forest fires.
 - Configuring the SVM model with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters, such as the kernel type and regularization parameter.
 
3. Model Evaluation and Tuning:
 - Evaluating the performance of the SVM model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
 - Tuning hyperparameters of the SVM model through techniques like GridSearchCV or manual adjustment to optimize performance.
 
4. Insights and Recommendations:
 - Deriving actionable insights from the trained SVM model to understand the key factors influencing the size category of forest fires.
 - Providing recommendations for forest fire prevention and management based on the model's predictions and insights.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, the project aims to provide a reliable and accurate classification model for predicting the size category of forest fires using SVM.
